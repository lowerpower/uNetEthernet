uNetEthernet 
=============

This is a very old project that includes a full software ARP/TCP/IPv4 stack. It
allows simple serial strings to control TCP and UDP sockets and ICMP pings. It
supports connecting any Ethernet network using DHCP or static IPV4 addresses.

Lots of cool modules, CRC16, Autobaud Rate Detection, Real Buffered TCP, DNS,
DHCP, full flow control buffered serial, serial bootloader to upgrade over
xmodem. This design can also run in full emulation on windows using winpcap.

Over 75K units have been deployed world wide. Can be built to run on a Atmel
MEGA64 or MEGA128 and possibly other AVR chips. Full documentation including
BOM, Manual, express PCB board. source code and schematics.
